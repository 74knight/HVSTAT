Installation Instructions
=========================
Installing HV Stat couldn't be any easier!
- For Firefox: Download HVS_FIREFOX.user.js and drag it into an open Firefox window.
- For Chrome: Download HVS_CHROME.crx and drag it into an open Chrome Window.

At the moment, Firefox users will need to have GreaseMonkey installed.
